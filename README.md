[View the live project here](https://ashb87.github.io/Quiz-Ms-Project-Two/) <br>

## About

This website has been created for my Milestone 2 Interactive Frontend Development project. 
I want to create a music quiz game with a varied choice of questions based on all types of music to test the users knowledge. The user will be given a random 10 questions, worth 10 points a quesiton, with 30 seconds to answer each.
With a maximum of 100 points availible, the user will then be able to save their high score and try to get on the top 5 leaderboard.

## User Experience-(UX)

### Site Goals

  1. I want the site to be attractive, responsive and easy to use for the user.
  2. I want the site to work as intended incrementing the quesitons and score as the user progresses, with the timer going down for each question.
  3. I want the user to have a varied choice of questions.
  4. I want the user to be able to save their score.
  5. I want the user to be able to navigate easily through the different pages of the site.

### User Stories

  * #### First Time Visitor Goals
    1. I want the game to be attractive and and easy to read all text.
    2. I want the game to be responsive to whichever device I am playing it on.
    3. I want to be able to navigate around the different pages of the site.
    4. I want to be able to learn how the game works.
    5. I want to be given a choice of varied questions.

  * #### Returning/ Frequent Visitor Goals
    1. I want to be given varied questions each time I play.
    2. I want to be able to record my score and try to get on a leaderboard.
    3. I want to see other users previous scores so I can try to beat them.

### Design

Because of the topic of the quiz, I want the design of the website to have a music themed background. It needs to be pleasing for the user to look at with the game elements easily distinguishable from the background so that everything is clear and easy to use. To do this I will have a fairly dark background with brighter colours being used for the game so they will contrast nicely together.
I want to keep a consistent theme throughout the site by using the same colour combinations on each page. With the site being attractive for the user and easy to use I am hoping the user will want to keep returning to play the game.



  * #### Wireframes

  To make my wireframes I have used balsamiq. I have done one for each page and did a design for larger screens and smaller screens to show how the site will be responsive to screen size and change accordingly. The links to each one are below.<br>
