##About

This website has been created for my Milestone 2 Interactive Frontend Development project. 
I want to create a music quiz game with a varied choice of questions based on all types of music to test the users knowledge. The user will be given a random 10 questions, worth 10 points a quesiton, with 30 seconds to answer each.
With a maximum of 100 points availible, the user will then be able to save their high score and try to get on the top 5 leaderboard.
